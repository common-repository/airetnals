== Description ==

The AIrentals plugin is intended to connect the AIRentals system and the WP website development services. Easy to use, it provides all the necessary services for building a tourist accommodation website (presentation, reservation, payment ...) within the WP system. AIRentals has multiple modules: 1. PMS (Property Management System), 2. CRS (Central Reservation System), and 3. CM (Channel Manager System). The PMS module is used in the domain of building the web on individual domains (own or aggregate). It contains all the information necessary for the presentation of the object on the web: descriptions, photos, price lists, etc. In agreement with the provider of the AIRentals system, it is possible to arrange the use of other modules - CRS (Central Reservation System) and 3rd CM (Channel Manager System).

When used for WP system functions, the connection between the AIRentals system and the WP part is required using the authentication code on the individual object obtained by registering on the AIRentals system.
